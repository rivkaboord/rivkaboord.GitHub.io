Following the New York Jets' first loss to the New England Patriots this season, 22-17, I went back into NFL history from the last 20 years to explore what the data says about Zach Wilson's long-term prospects. The answer was grim, and it is bearing out in the fact that he was benched before completing his second season as the former No. 2 overall pick.

There is a perception among some New York Jets fans that Zach Wilson's height makes it more difficult for him to succeed as an NFL quarterback. I decided to look back at both the numbers and the history of previous quarterbacks of a similar height to explore whether the claim has any merit.
