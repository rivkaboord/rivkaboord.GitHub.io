Following the New York Jets' first loss to the New England Patriots this season, 22-17, I went back into NFL history from the last 20 years to explore what the data says about Zach Wilson's long-term prospects. The answer was grim, and it is bearing out in the fact that he was benched before completing his second season as the former No. 2 overall pick.

#### [Does Zach Wilson's height affect him as a quarterback?](https://jetsxfactor.com/2022/11/03/zach-wilson-height-struggles/)
<img src="/images/Zach Wilson height.jpg"/>
There is a perception among some New York Jets fans that Zach Wilson's height makes it more difficult for him to succeed as an NFL quarterback. I decided to look back at both the numbers and the history of previous quarterbacks of a similar height to explore whether the claim has any merit.

#### [How Mike LaFleur can improve his play-calling in 2022](https://jetsxfactor.com/2022/07/18/how-can-ny-jets-mike-lafleur-improve-play-calling-2022/)

Heading into the 2022 season, the New York Jets had a lot to improve on offense. I took a look at some of their offensive play-calling trends and discussed what needed to change for the Jets to be successful.

#### [Why the New York Mets' offense is a big problem heading into the playoffs](/files/Why the Mets' offense is a big problem heading into the playoffs.docx)

As the New York Mets neared the 2022 playoff push, I explored their offensive struggles and how they might cause the team issues heading into October.<br>

You can find the code that I used to generate the data [here](/files/mets_2022_runs_scored.R).

#### [The New York Jets' play-calling was predictable in Week 14 loss to Bills](https://jetsxfactor.com/2022/12/13/lafleur-play-calling-predictable/)

Using a metric called XPASS, I examined the Jets' play-calling tendencies in their 20-12 loss to the Bills and explained how the predictability directly contributed to their defeat.

I wrote and built custom functions and models in R to assess the main drivers behind employee attrition and implemented a personalized plan to promote retention, which saved a company $15 million.

<img src="images/bikes.jpg"/>
I took bikeshop data regarding sales of different types of bikes and generated a report. [Here](/files/03_sales_report.Rmd) is the code used to generate the report.
